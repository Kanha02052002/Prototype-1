Issue: System working slow
--------------------------------
Symptoms:
- System takes a long time to respond.
- Applications freeze frequently.
- Overall lag in performance.

Possible Causes:
- Too many applications running in the background.
- Specific application cache/data overloaded.
- Insufficient system memory (RAM).
- Pending updates slowing down processes.

Diagnosis Steps:
1. Check if the system is slow only when using a specific application or at all times.
2. If specific application: clear cache/data of that application and restart it.
3. If system-wide: restart the system and close unused applications.
4. Check Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac) to see if CPU/memory is heavily used.
5. If issue persists after restart: verify if disk space is almost full.

Non-Technical Checks:
- Ensure no heavy downloads or background processes are running.
- Run a quick system cleanup (delete temporary files).
- Check if system updates are pending and complete them.
- If the issue still persists, contact ERP technical support.
