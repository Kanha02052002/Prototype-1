[2025-09-15 11:25:53] User: Quick fixes provided
[2025-09-15 11:25:53] Bot: 1. **Run Outlook as Administrator**  
   Right-click on the Outlook shortcut or executable file and select "Run as administrator." This can resolve permission-related crashes that occur during startup.

2. **Repair or Reinstall Outlook**  
   Go to Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features, select Microsoft Office, and choose "Repair." If that doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall Outlook to fix corrupted files or missing components.

3. **Update or Reinstall .NET Framework and Visual C++ Redistributables**  
   Since Outlook relies on these runtime components, outdated or missing versions can cause immediate crashes. Download and install the latest versions of .NET Framework 4.8 and Visual C++ Redistributable from Microsoft’s official website.
